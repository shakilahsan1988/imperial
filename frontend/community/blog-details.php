                            Six years ago, my mother was hospitalized at one of Bangladesh’s top hospitals for a basic operation. We expected that the routine procedure would go smoothly, yet she suffered such dramatic complications that we nearly lost her. The most harrowing part of the experience was the doctor’s cavalier attitude. On my mother’s worst day, my sister and I desperately needed to understand why our mother was vomiting bile, but the doctor ignored our queries and walked out of the room. I distinctly remember chasing him up two flights of stairs to demand answers to our simple questions. His indifference to our mother’s suffering made us feel completely helpless. Eventually, our family had no choice but to take my mother to Bangkok, where she had a second surgery. A year later, she had to have a third surgery, all because of complications arising from the original operation.

                                    Like most Bangladeshis, I could share dozens of other shocking incidents like this one, experienced by my own family in private health facilities. I am an American by birth and Bangladeshi by blood. I studied international law and international development at top universities in the United States. My passion for development and impact was inspired by my visits to Bangladesh growing up and led me to a rewarding career in New York City and beyond. For the past 15 years, I have worked to ensure human rights and justice for individuals all over the world, through the private and public sectors, at international law firms and global organizations. After my mother’s experience, I spent a great deal of time thinking about the tremendous need to revolutionize the health sector in Bangladesh. I wanted to be part of that revolution. So, I moved to Bangladesh to found Praava Health.
